# Webshop Project

## Description

This project is a group assignment where we have developed an online store using React, Next.js, TypeScript, and the MUI design system. The webshop includes four main pages: a homepage, a product page, a checkout page, and a confirmation page.

### Features

- **Homepage**: Displays various products that users can click on to read more details on the product page.
- **Product Page**: Provides detailed information about each product and the option to add it to the shopping cart.
- **Checkout Page**: Manages the shopping cart, showing the quantity, price, and total cost of the products. Users can adjust the quantity or remove products.
- **Confirmation Page**: Summarizes the purchase and provides a unique order number after the purchase is completed.

### Admin Page

- Administrators can manage (add, remove, edit) products through the admin page.

## Technical Details

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-rendered and static web applications.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Design System**: MUI (Material-UI) for handling UI components and styling.
